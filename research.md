## Agentic AI Systems for Data Processing & Clinical Risk Prediction

  <p>Real-world EHR data are messy: missingness, human error, outliers, and workflow effects can dominate signal and undermine clinical prediction. My research develops <strong>agentic AI systems</strong> that automatically diagnose data quality issues, execute reproducible preprocessing and feature engineering, and generate clinically grounded representations for modeling, while recording provenance and decision rationales for auditability and interpretability. These pipelines also include agents that select modeling strategies, configure hyperparameter tuning and validation, and adapt workflows to the dataset and clinical endpoint under explicit constraints (e.g., leakage control and robustness checks). I apply these methods across <strong>structured data</strong>, <strong>unstructured clinical text</strong> (e.g., notes and discharge summaries), and <strong>imaging</strong> for perioperative risk prediction (including elective spine surgery outcomes) and for predicting problematic opioid use / opioid use disorder.</p>

## Clinical NLP for Substance Use Phenotyping

<div style="display: flex; gap: 2rem; align-items: flex-start; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <p>Substance use disorders are often under-coded in structured EHR fields, with key evidence embedded in clinical narratives. My research develops <strong>clinical NLP and phenotyping frameworks</strong> that extract and organize substance-use–related signals from notes and discharge summaries while preserving clinical context (e.g., negation, temporality, uncertainty, and attribution). A major focus is <strong>problematic opioid use/opioid use disorder</strong>, where I build context-aware annotation and modeling pipelines to distinguish clinically meaningful patterns such as active use vs historical use, treatment and recovery markers, and severity-related indicators. These phenotypes are designed to be reproducible and evaluation-ready, supporting downstream prediction, cohort discovery, and longitudinal risk profiling.</p>

## Epistasis & Complex Trait Genetics

<div style="display: flex; gap: 2rem; align-items: flex-start; margin: 2rem 0;">

  <p>Complex traits—including disease risk, treatment response, and behavioral phenotypes—often depend on <strong>epistatic (gene-gene) interactions</strong> that elude standard single-variant analyses. My research develops computational methods that detect, model, and interpret these non-additive genetic effects at scale. This includes novel genotype encoding strategies, interaction-aware machine learning models, and simulation frameworks for benchmarking epistasis detection. Applications span addiction genetics, metabolic traits, and model organism studies, with a focus on making interaction findings biologically interpretable and clinically actionable.</p>

## Ecological & Evolutionary Genomics

<div style="display: flex; gap: 2rem; align-items: flex-start; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <p>My earlier research explored how organisms adapt to environmental challenges across complex life cycles. Using <em>Drosophila</em> as a model system, I investigated <strong>thermal hardiness</strong> and its genetic architecture across developmental stages, finding evidence for stage-specific genetic control of stress tolerance. This work combined quantitative genetics, transcriptomics, and functional assays to understand how selection shapes physiological traits differently in larvae vs. adults—a phenomenon with broad implications for predicting species' responses to climate change.</p>
