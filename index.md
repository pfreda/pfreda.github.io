<div class="intro-text">

I work at the intersection of **clinical informatics**, **machine learning**, and **translational research**, focusing on transforming messy, real-world electronic health record (EHR) data into actionable, clinically grounded representations for predictive modeling and decision support.

My research spans several interconnected domains:

- **Clinical Informatics & AI for Real-World Data** — Building agentic AI systems that automate data quality assessment, preprocessing, and feature engineering while maintaining full provenance and interpretability
- **Substance Use Disorders & Clinical NLP** — Developing phenotyping frameworks that extract nuanced substance-use signals from clinical narratives, with a focus on opioid use disorder
- **Knowledge Graphs & AI-Human Collaboration** — Constructing structured frameworks that encode relationships among clinical concepts, data operations, and validation evidence
- **Patient Heterogeneity & Risk Stratification** — Identifying clinically meaningful subgroups and generating calibrated risk estimates for reliable patient stratification
- **Computational Genetics & AutoML** — Advancing methods for detecting epistatic interactions and non-additive genetic effects in complex trait association studies
