<div class="intro-text">
  <p>The <strong>Freda Lab</strong> is based in the <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/research/departments-institutes/computational-biomedicine.html">Department of Computational Biomedicine</a> at <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/">Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</a> in Los Angeles, CA.</p>

  <p>We develop AI-driven methods that make clinical data more usable for prediction, discovery, and decision support. Our work sits at the intersection of clinical informatics, machine learning, and translational research, with a focus on building automated (and increasingly agentic) pipelines that transform noisy EHR data into clinically actionable representations.</p>

  <p>Major themes of our research include improving risk identification for adverse spine surgery outcomes and for problematic opioid use/opioid use disorder, leveraging structured EHR elements, clinical narratives, imaging, and social determinants of health to model patient risk and heterogeneity. We also design knowledge-graph–based frameworks that capture relationships among clinical concepts, data quality operations, and model behavior to support transparent, auditable AI workflows and human–AI collaboration.</p>
