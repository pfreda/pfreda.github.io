<div class="intro-text">
  <p>I am a Research Scientist I and clinical informatician in the <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/research/departments-institutes/computational-biomedicine.html">Department of Computational Biomedicine</a> at <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/">Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</a> in Los Angeles, CA.</p>

  <p>I develop AI-driven methods that make clinical data more usable for prediction, discovery, and decision support. My work sits at the intersection of clinical informatics, machine learning, and translational research, with a focus on building automated (and increasingly agentic) pipelines that transform noisy EHR data into clinically actionable representations. A major theme of my research is improving risk identification for adverse spine surgery outcomes and for problematic opioid use/opioid use disorder, leveraging structured EHR elements, clinical narratives, imaging, and social determinants of health to model patient risk and heterogeneity.</p>

  <p>I also design knowledge-graph–based frameworks that capture relationships among clinical concepts, data quality operations, and model behavior to support transparent, auditable AI workflows and human–AI collaboration. My earlier training in computational genetics and complex trait analysis informs how I think about high-dimensional interactions, robustness, and generalization, but my current emphasis is on clinically grounded, scalable AI systems for real-world healthcare data.</p>
